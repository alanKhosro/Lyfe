Yet another language: Interpreted, Static-Typed, Math-Friendly, Functional, Weak OO, Brief, High-Level, Layered, Evolution-Based 


Specs of a new language:
- Interpreter
- Static typed
- Concine and brief
- Easy to read
- Separation of data and behavior 
- Math like 
    - A.f: (a int=0, s str, d {int, int}) -> (i int) {

    }

- Language semantic
- Symbols define
    - [] Array: has order, no name, has duplicates, open-ended
    - () Tuple: has order or name, closed-ended, has duplicates
    - <> Set: no order or duplicate, open-ended 
    - {} Closure/dictionary: open-ended, separated by;, key: value, 
    -
- Operator, binary and unary 


A: <a int, b []int, C, d D> -> <f, g, h>
